<h1>Troubleshooting 2 | MUST 4707</h1>

<h2>Finding Errors in Existing Code and Fixing Them</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you will update the file <code>script.js</code> and commit it to your assignment repository. Your updated version of <code>script.js</code> should run without any errors. The object <code>myWinterCoat</code> should have all of the proper syntax required of an object. If it does, it will export properly and your code will pass all of the tests.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
